## Overview

This was created as a simple utility to watch the
temperature of the Pi from a remote terminal. It's 
nothing special and therefore won't be documented past
a simple `make`. ðŸ™ƒ

If anyone finds it useful, please enjoy!



## Build instructions

Just cd into the project root directory and run: 
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
